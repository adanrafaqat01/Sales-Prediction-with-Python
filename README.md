# 📊 Sales Prediction Using Python

This project is part of the *Data Zenix Data Science Internship Program*.

It uses advertising data to build machine learning models that *predict product sales* based on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertisement budgets.

## 📁 Project Overview

- 🔍 *Objective*: Predict how much sales will be generated based on ad spending
- 🧠 *Models Used*:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- 📊 *Metrics Evaluated*:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## 📌 Dataset

- *Source*: [Advertising Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bumba5341/advertisingcsv)
- *Columns*:
  - TV: Budget for TV ads
  - Radio: Budget for radio ads
  - Newspaper: Budget for newspaper ads
  - Sales: Product sales (target variable)

## 📈 Results

### 🔹 Linear Regression:
- R² Score: *0.899*
- MAE: *3.17*
- MSE: *3.17*

### 🔹 Random Forest:
- R² Score: *0.981*
- MAE: *0.59*
- MSE: *0.59*

✅ *Random Forest performed better* and was chosen as the final model.
